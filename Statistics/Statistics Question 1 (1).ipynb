    "Ans: In correlation coefficient we are trying to restrict the values between -1 to 1.Here we are trying to define a scale. More the value towards +1 is, the more positively correlated it is, 0 represents no correlation and the more the value towards -1 is, the more negatively correlated it is. Here, the value of 0.7 suggests a relatively strong positive correlation between SAT scores and college GPA.\n",
    "so, A correlation coefficient of 0.7 between SAT scores and college GPA indicates a strong positive relationship between the two variables.\n"
